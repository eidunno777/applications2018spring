      <p>For this project I am going to create a pizza customizer that will turn pizza customization into an enjoyable visual experience. I intend to put my illustration skills to work for this project and create custom icons and animations for each time someone adds a pizza topping (Meats and Non-Meats. I am planning to have the pizza take center screen and then each time a topping is chosen the selected topping rains down on the pizza (only will allow a certain number of toppings).<br>
      For Next class I will have the lofi-mockups for what I want the all the pages to look like and what all there content will be.<br>
      For the next class I will create the visual wireframes for all the pages (which will continue to be refined in the coming weeks)
      For the class after that I will hopefully have most of the illustration graphics done for all the topics and icons.<br>
      For the class after that I will have most of the animations done.<br>
      For the next class I create the HTML page and link the animations to the buttons (which will also feature the illustrated icons).
      The next couple classes will be about refinement.</p>
